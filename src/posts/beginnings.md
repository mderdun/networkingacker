## Introduction
In this post, I'm going to explain the foundations of this project, what I've done so far, and if it's of any interest to you, some personal context to the project. <Highlighter>It will be admittedly verbose, and if you're looking for a more concise synopsis, please have a look at the dedicated [About](https://networkingacker.mderdun.com/about) page</Highlighter> (which might actually still be under construction...).

This blog is a space for me to develop and reflect on my ideas. I am going into my third year of a three-year undergraduate degree in English Literature at Durham University. I've chosen a difficult subject for my dissertation, one that's part of a much greater research vision that I hope I can carry out in the future. The toolkit I've opted for is a mix of the old and the new. All aspects I hope will come together to encourage and challenge both broader, abstract concepts, as well as close critical commentary.

## Networking Acker
In short, <Highlighter>the project is tracing Kathy Acker's networks.</Highlighter> I like phrasing it this way because it leaves things open to so many different meanings. What kind of networks might these be? Social networks, networks of web links? Textual ones? Abstract, conceptual networks? Or even neural networks? 

I would love to find ways of mapping all of these, but that would be something not easily produced on my own in the span of a few years, let alone the less-than-a-year I have to submit my dissertation.

For the <Highlighter>current stage of the project</Highlighter>, I'm focusing on the networks of narrative and identity in Acker's works. I'm interested in the ways Acker uses and abuses (but mostly abuses) the conventions of narrative and identity to create a kind of networked text. I'm also interested in the ways Acker's own identity is networked, and how she uses her own identity to create a networked text.

So network theory and narrative identity theory will be key outlooks for this project. Networks lend themselves well to digital analysis, but Acker's fractured narratives don't. There's a lot of work to be done to reconcile these two approaches, and I'm hoping to find a way to do that.

I've been heavily influenced by theoretical networks ever since I first read Spinoza and Deleuze. But I've had an attraction to networked thinking for as long as I can remember, it's how my mind works instinctively. Recently reading Acker's interviews, I feel I can deeply relate to her:
>ACKER (to Sylvère Lotringer): Well, meeting you influenced me—you don't like influence—but it changed me a lot because by introducing me to French philosophers, you gave me a way of verbalizing what I had been doing in language[...] I remember thinking, Why don't they know me! I know exactly what they're talking about! And I could go farther, that was the big thing for me. I had a real sense, until that happened that I was like this kind of deaf-dumb-and-blind person for years; I just did what I did but I had no way of telling anyone about it, or talking about it.^1

So there is a dual purpose of pursuing network thinking in its theory and practice. One is of course for the aims of the project. The other is out of personal desire for the best way to express, experience, and indulge in a particular way of thinking, a way which brings me joy and fulfilment because it aligns most closely with my own experience.

## So far...
I've done a lot of thinking already. And a lot of reading, both of theory and of Acker. <Highlighter>The main struggle here is scope,</Highlighter> finding something tight enough that can be workable in the timeframe, but also broad enough to enable me to really explore networks.

One of the worst parts of working with more contemporary authors is text availability. I'm not so worried about copyright, as I wouldn't be publishing any of their work in datasets, only the transformed outcomes. But Acker's works are hard enough to come by as they are in their physical form, and preparing her oeuvre for digital analysis is a whole other task.

I'm beginning to settle on a snapshot of her works, the easiest way in would be to take a look at the period that really made her name, the 1980s. Focusing on texts like *Great Expectations* (1982), *Blood and Guts in High School* (1984), *Don Quixote* (1986), *Empire of the Senseless* (1988), and *In Memoriam to Identity* (1990). But there's also a wealth of identity issues in her earliest works, I'm thinking *Black Tarantula* (1973), *My Death My Life* (1974), or even the earlier journal fragments that have come to be recently published.

Selection here is key. The thing with data is that it's a completely different outlook to what literature students are used to. There's a decent chance that you'll do all this work, run it through all your algorithms and visualisations, and never find anything of interest. But then again, there's a lot you can do to create narrative with data.

So <Highlighter>I need to know why I'm doing the things I'm doing.</Highlighter> No choice is arbitrary.

Anyway, some things I'm interested in doing are running the texts through something like BookNLP to extract character and event information. There's some great work that's been done out there (it's late and I'm not getting my bibliography up, sorry) in terms of mapping narrative arcs too, and I'd be interested to see if there's a tool for analysing temporal shifts in narrative. Network mapping with tools like Gephi or python's networkx library will be good, and tracing geolocation data also useful.

In terms of specific theory, Paul Ricoeur has proved a solid foundation. As I mentioned, theres Deleuze, and then there are more specific writers fleshing out narrative identity theory more recently in the last decade or so. I'll figure out a way to get a bibliography page up soon (I'm sure a network can be made of that, too).

## Some Personal Context

This project is, in many ways, not new at all. At the very least, it's been on my mind for close to a year now.

I've been reading Acker much longer than just that. In the Summer of 2019, I was introduced to her writing, it must have been by some tangent of my interests in the film-maker Harmony Korine. I had been reading his only book, *A Crack Up at the Race Riots* (1998) and I wanted so desperately to find something that replicated that same sardonic energy. <Highlighter>Only on reflection can I see that the impulse to dig up the roots of that energy are the same currents that brought me to study literature.</Highlighter>

I was yet to finalise my A-level choices at this point. I had put myself down for Maths, Economics, Music, and Philosophy, and it was only a scheduling clash that saw me change Philosophy for English Literature. The stuff I was reading, the kind of things that really interested me, just didn't seem *literary*, and I had been put off by the inflexible numbness of the secondary school Literature curriculum. Feeling at this point like I *had* to study English, and not that I *wanted* to, I resolved to make the most of it by making what I wanted to do work any way possible.

I leaned into being "off-task". I was motivated, and not discouraged, when feedback would come in saying I had been "too ambitious" or had gone "beyond the question". I worked at my own interests, weaving them into my work, while staying on top of developing strong critical and theoretical foundations. I learned through adults that these were skills well suited to research, and so after my A-levels I decided to find an institution where I could be encouraged to explore.

I ended up at Durham, and I've been very happy here. There's a good mix of freedom and prescribed academic rigour that combine to make a very rewarding learning experience. And I've been able to develop skills in my own ways.

The Digital Humanities I stumbled upon kinda by accident. Not that I didn't know what I was doing, but that I didn't know I was doing *DH*. The first ever assignment I submited was for an *Introduction to Poetry* module, and I was interested in whether the human voice was defining of poetry. I took this literally, but also more figuratively. Towards the end of the essay I'd generated three poems using some early AI generators (this was before the GPT revolution) and analysed them in the same vein of all the previous poems I'd discussed. I found that there was some meaning that I could make of them, meaning that seemed more than an arbitrary coincidence, and which, in many ways, demonstrated an awareness of the *inhuman* AI voice.

I loved that these topics felt so fresh, so far from being closed, and so I made a point of pursuing the digital applications of literary study. I've been entirely self-taught, and have recently been lucky to test and develop my skills in a serious research environment.

I'm hoping to continue this project after my degree, and I'm hoping to find a way to make it my career. I'm not sure what that would look like, but I'm sure I'll find a way.

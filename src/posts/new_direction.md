## Stuck in the Mud
If the recent additions of my handwritten notes to the blog are anything to go by, it's fair to say I've been frustrated with the project.

Here's the gist of my core issue:
- Acker makes no sense. It's why I love her writing. But it's also what makes it so hard to work with, so hard to translate for computers and to be algorithmic about.
    - How, for example, do I process her texts? Encoding them would be nightmarish, unsuitable for hierarchical data structures. Even the question of classification would involve highly subjective decisions on the granular level of words and sentences. Her works aren't just linguistic units or literatures existing in relation to a common set of rules, they have their own internal, often contradictory rules. Tools trained on large literary and textual datasets might tell me how Acker's writing relates to other writing, but they won't tell me how Acker's writing relates to itself, how it builds itself from the inside-out.
    - Even if I could wrangle the textual elements, what then of Acker's elaborate dream maps? Her juvenile drawings of dicks across the page? Her tattoos, the curation of her self through body-building and piercing? 

There are also other, more pragmatic issues:
- Copyright... boring
- Poor access to archives. I would love to be the one to digitise these, even just take a look at them myself, but unless there is someone out there reading this that would like to fund me for a trip to NYC and Cologne, I don't see it happening any time soon.
- Time constraints.
- Technical constraints. My knowledge is but lowly and humble (relatively speaking)... And there's only one of me. 

## A Diamond in the Rough
(I'm moving this blog post through quite quickly because it's late and I've been over the frustrations in my head too many times already.)

I first came across this edition about a year ago while writing what is surprisingly my only essay on Acker to date. The one I'm talking about is Éditions Ismael's *Kathy Acker 1971-1975*, a pioneering critical edition of a large selection of Acker's unpublished early works. Here's the publisher's own summary on the presentation of the edition:
<Quote> 
<span slot="quote">

This book is the first attempt to produce a critical edition of a large number of Kathy Acker’s unpublished early works. Apart from the posthumous publication, in 2002, of the early manuscript Rip-off Red, Girl Detective and The Burning Bombing of America: The Destruction of the U.S. by Amy Scholder and Grove Press in one volume, in 2002, as well as Gabrielle Kappes’ chapbook, no other important publication had been attempted in this field. <br />
These – mostly unpublished – texts were all composed between 1969 and 1976. Yet they are representative of Acker’s published output only for the period running from 1971 to early 1974. These texts all exist as “clean” typewritten copies, probably intended to be kept, shown, maybe even published. The editor chose not to include Acker’s manuscripts. The transcriptions in this volume were made directly from the original typescripts. Original pagination, manuscript addenda, missing pages and other idiosyncrasies of each file have been preserved; our editorial notes at the end of the texts all feature a material description of the source version used. <br />
The organization of this volume is chronological. The texts’ respective date of composition is often the result of an estimate based on their content and form (an estimate that is then justified and defended). <br />
Such a collection shows how prolific, diverse and always in-progress Acker’s production was in those years. It isn’t, however, Acker’s complete early works. More typescripts exist at the Fales Library which aren’t featured or alluded to in this book. Their publication and analysis may in the future suggest a whole new set of interpretations that will, or might not, contradict the present editor’s exegesis. Moreover, the comparison of the typescripts with manuscript versions will undoubtedly inspire new perspectives on Acker’s creative process and intentions during those years.

As you can see, the collection is admittedly an incomplete one. But it's a very good start, perhaps the best start I can have for the limited scope of the project. All I need is a solid foundation off of which to build, excercising and experimenting with the tools I want to use. And it doesn't prevent me from doing the further work that I want to further down the line.

Here's how I believe this edition maneuvers around the issues I've been having:
- This is Acker at her earliest stage. Not less complex or rewarding, but her writing is characteristically more textual.
    - Processing the texts isn't simplified just by virtue of them already being neatly processed, but also because many of the editorial decisions I would have had to make are present. And what's more, is that they are well documented, meaning they themselves can be a point of scrutiny and reflection (questioning how and why the editor made the decisions they did). I'm not afraid of editorialising, the current project I'm working on at CRIHN is entirely that, it's just that I've seen how time and labour intensive it is, and it simply isn't a process suitable for the constraints I have.
    - The texts are also "more textual" in that they have been made for the printed page (not that this ever stopped Acker). Take the example below, the opening sequence from Acker's 1972 poem, *Journal Black Cat Black Jewels*. A lot of it looks like this, these are typewritten copies at the end of the day, and aside from the odd intervention by pencil or pen over the top, they present (relatively) straightforward. Perfect news for mining and processing.

As for the pragmatic issues, here's the good news:
- The edition is *almost* open access. It is a BY-NC-ND Creative Commons license, meaning that it can be freely copied and redistributed, as long as there is appropriate credit given, and, if remixed, that the modified version is not distributed. Given that any transformations would only be for internal use, this is great news, and the publisher offers a freely accessible PDF version which I can work from.
- The archive question is essentially solved here via intermediary. Sure, it's not perfect in the sense of scope or access to the original materials, but it is an editorially rigorous and well documented selection, including almost all the typescripts available from the period. The selection is well-rounded, including poems, prose, diary entries, and even a transcription of the infamous 1974 *Blue Tape*. There are further additions I could append, such as the posthumously published *Rip-Off Red* and *The Burning Bombing of America* which were written around the same time, or some of Acker's essays such as her writings for the *L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E* publication (of which there is a good facsimile version available), but this is a good place to start at least for the time-being.
- The work of the editors (for which I am grateful) saves me a lot of time as I've mentioned. This means I can focus on the processing and analysis of the texts, and reinforcing them with critical and theoretical thought and reading.

I believe that <Highlighter>the work I can do on top of this edition would be more than sufficiently transformative, and would tie in questions of editorialising and presenting Acker (another aspect of the Acker "identity" that I initially wanted to explore).</Highlighter> The time period is one that I toyed with previously, and represents a key developmental period of Acker's writing which culminates and coincides with breakthrough works such as *The Childlike Life of the Black Tarantula* and *I Dreamt I Was a Nymphomaniac*. 

## Final Reservations...
The outstanding issues here are, I believe, more minor than what I've previously been struggling with. They revolve around the two questions of:
- Will relying on an intermediary edition be a problem, particularly in terms of the perceived integrity and originality of the project?
- And, will the scope of the edition be too limited, and will I be able to do enough with it?

The answer to both is in many ways, let's find out and see. But I have confidence to back myself in both situations. I believe the work I want to do *is* transformative and original, with the potential to be valuable scholarly contribution. And the scope should be enough, perhaps not in the break-through way that I want to aim towards, but good as excercise and proof of concept. I know I want to continue this work into the future, so this will leave me with a lot to build on and work with.

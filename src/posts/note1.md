Like an XYZ axis.
<br /><br />
X is SPACE/PLACE—
<br />
Acker -- mobile writer, but so are her texts and characters, skimming across geographical, imagined, and bibliographic (inter-textual) space.
<br /><br />
Y is FORM/MEDIUM—
<br />
Acker constructs narrative identity across various mediums. These include textual forms but also her physicality (think body-building,+ tattoo) and her networks (social life as a medium OR JUST LIFE GENERALLY)
<br /><br />
Z is TIME—
<br />
Acker's identity evolving across time but also flouting it by upholding irresolvable paradoxes. How does the Narrative Time of the novels compare? if there even is a measurable sense of it...
<br /><br />
A way to understand complex identity. The way that non-Euclidean or upper-dimension shapes are paradoxical / impossible in “flatter” dimensions. I'm sounding like a consipracy theorist here. But maybe?

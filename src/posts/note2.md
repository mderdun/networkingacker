<p class="hand">
Realising this project is huge EVeN when I dumb it down. Theory is too easy, not used to being held back by practical limitations as a Humanist but I imagine (somewhat sarcastically) that this is what theoretical physicists feel.
<br />
Acker's writing is DeePLY ambiguous. Was that last page a piece of DRAMA, or NARRATORIAL VeNTRILOQUISM, or ARBITRARY PAGe DeCORATION?? probably some mesh of them all... If I can't decide, how is a computer supposed to decide? I don't believe this is a check-mate for the "irreplacibility of Humanists" (I have ideas—again, just theory—of how to get past this), but it sure is an annoying roadblock. How to proceed? Some options:
<br /><br />
—Ignore the problem.
<br />
——Find some "easy" Acker.
<br />
———Word-level analysis only (character maps probs would need to be done manually)
<br />
————Write about theory and cry
<br /><br />
Surely there must be another way???
